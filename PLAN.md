# dot plan

## TODO

- define a common IR that supports integer and rational linear
  expressions and relations
- implement an LQA solver using FME with arbitrary precision rationals
- implement an LIA solver using the Omega Test
- add pre-processing and translation passes to go from the
  quantifier-free fragment of the front-end AST to the IR for FME/Omega
  problems
- implement quantifier elimination

- identify benchmarks
  - vs. Rocq-Omega benchmarks
  - Lean `grind` tests
- BigZ, BigQ choice https://crates.io/crates/num-rational
